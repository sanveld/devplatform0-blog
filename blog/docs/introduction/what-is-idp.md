# What is an Internal Developer Platform?

An Internal Developer Platform (IDP) is a layer on top of your cloud infrastructure that enables developers to self-serve the resources they need without having to understand the underlying cloud complexities.

## Core Concepts

An effective IDP provides:

- **Self-Service Infrastructure**: Developers can request the infrastructure they need without waiting for platform/ops teams
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All resources are defined and managed as code
- **GitOps Workflow**: Changes to infrastructure happen through Git commits and PR processes
- **Standardization**: Predefined templates and patterns ensure consistent resource provisioning
- **Abstraction**: Complex cloud details are hidden behind simplified interfaces

## Why Build an IDP?

- **Developer Productivity**: Eliminate waiting time for infrastructure provisioning
- **Consistency**: Ensure resources are deployed according to organizational standards
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers don't need to become cloud experts
- **Governance & Compliance**: Built-in guardrails and approval processes
- **Cost Control**: Better visibility and management of cloud resources

## About Our IDP PoC

This Internal Developer Platform Proof of Concept aims to validate:

1. The feasibility of using Kubernetes (AKS) as a control plane
2. Crossplane for managing Azure resources via custom abstractions
3. GitOps workflows for developer resource requests
4. Infrastructure as Code principles throughout the platform

Our vision is to create a minimal, functional platform that enables developers to request and manage Azure infrastructure through a Git-based workflow, with all platform components defined as code.
